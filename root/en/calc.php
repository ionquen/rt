It can be useful everywhere: at home, at work or at school. \r\n\r\nIt is suitable for any activity: for engineering calculations, for solving problems by formulas, for quickly finding the sum and difference, product and quotient of any numbers. \r\n\r\nThere is support for such actions as: exponentiation, finding the root, finding the percentage of the number and using parentheses to indicate the sequence of calculations. \r\nWe have provided a lot of nice features for users:\r\n\r\n1. User-friendly, minimalistic, with large buttons interface\r\n2. History of calculations\r\n3. Memory cells\r\n4. Can work without internet\r\n5. A lot of little things that contribute to the pleasant use of the calculator.\r\n\r\nOur calculator is adapted for different devices, such as tablets, smartphones, personal computers. \r\n\r\n## Buttons and hotkeys\r\nEach button has its own purpose and a corresponding hotkey on the keyboard to make calculations quickly.\r\nThe keys located on the numpad are also supported. \r\n\r\n| Button | Hotkeys | Assignment |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| `+` | `+` | Add (addition) |\r\n| `-` | `-` | Subtract (subtraction) |\r\n| `*` | `*` | Multiply by (multiplication) |\r\n| `/` | `/` | Divide by (division) |\r\n| `%` | `%` | Get a percentage |\r\n| `C` | `Home` | Clear the input field |\r\n| `M` | `m` | Add result to memory |\r\n| `RM`| | Insert the last number stored in memory |\r\n| `←` | `Backspace` | Delete the character(s) before the cursor |\r\n|  | `Delete` | Delete character(s) after cursor |\r\n| `(` | `(` | Opening parenthesis |\r\n| `)` | `)` | Closing parenthesis |\r\n| `^` | `^` | Ascension to a degree |\r\n| `√` | | Finding the root of degree n (after clicking write degree) |\r\n| `!` | `!` | Factorial (put at the end of the expression for which the factorial is located) |\r\n| `e` | `e` | Number e |\r\n| `π` | `p` | The number π |\r\n| `log` | `Shift + l` | The logarithm of a number based on 10 |\r\n| `ln` | `l` | The logarithm of a number based on e |\r\n| `tg` | `t` | Tangent |\r\n| `cos` | `c` | Cosine |\r\n| `sin` | `s` | Sine |\r\n| `rand`| `r` | Random digit |\r\n| `=` | `=` `Enter` | Sums it up by replacing the input string with the result |\r\n\r\nThe calculator constantly makes a summary, allowing you to get the result as soon as the expression is entered. \r\n\r\nThe calculator supports the input of a user expression through the use of [keyboard shortcuts] (notepad/shortcut) `Ctrl + V'. \r\n\r\nTo copy the result, just make a simple click on it.\r\n\r\nOn our website there is support for full-screen mode for the calculator.\r\n\r\n## Memory Cells\r\nThis calculator supports a convenient extended system of memory cells. During calculations, you will be able to save intermediate results in memory cells through a special button or hotkey, and then apply the saved value in other calculations. \r\n\r\nThis functionality is useful when you need to temporarily store intermediate values somewhere. Previously, the only memory cell available in the calculator was used for this, or the result was copied into a notepad or other text document. Here it is enough to add this value to a special list. This list can contain up to 10 values.\r\n\r\nTo insert a saved number, click on this number in the sidebar where these values are saved.\r\n## Computing history\r\nThe online calculator also provides an automatically saved calculation history. \r\n\r\nMemory cells and history are available after the site page is reloaded and they can always be cleared by clicking on the appropriate buttons.\r\n\r\n## Historical facts\r\nThe calculator as a computing device has a history of more than 300 years. Throughout history , such devices have been created as:\r\n\r\n1. Adding machines that find the sum of numbers between the values entered and stored in the device. \r\n2. Tabulators that process information recorded on punched cards.\r\n3. Arithmometers designed to accurately perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.\r\n4. Electronic calculators powered by electricity."}
