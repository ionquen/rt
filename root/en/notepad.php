This notebook is suitable for any tasks: office work, study, household chores. \r\nThe main purpose of the online notepad is that it works quickly and allows you to add any notes at lightning speed without creating unnecessary files and without running huge word processors.\r\n\r\n## Why should I use an online notepad?\r\n\r\n1. No registration and authorization. \r\n2. No restrictions and subscriptions - everything is free.\r\n3. No need to download and install anything. A regular browser is suitable for the program to work.\r\n4. Multiple notebooks on one page - on this site you can create an unlimited number of notebooks and quickly switch between them.  \r\n5. Nothing superfluous. Word processors such as `MS Word`, `OpenOffice Write` have excessive functionality that most people do not use, while they consume huge system resources. If we need to perform elementary actions with the text - edit or format it, it doesn't make sense to use large word processors.\r\n\r\n## Where is the text stored?\r\nThe text you enter is not transmitted anywhere over the network to other people's servers, as other editors can do, but is stored on your own computer, right in the browser. To do this, a database built into the browser is used, which allows you to store a huge amount of information. The text is constantly auto-saved, so you don't have to worry if the power goes out or the tab closes. \r\n\r\nTo save texts in our notepad, it is important not to clear the site data, including local storage and databases. If they are deleted, all the texts typed in the editor will be lost.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nOur editor allows you to work with data in HTML format. When copying blocks from any sites, formatting is also copied, that is, it is possible to insert images, tables, links, formatted text and complex HTML with CSS structures.\r\n\r\n## Notepad Interface\r\nThe interface provides the following functions:\r\n\r\n| Keyboard shortcuts | Description |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| `Ctrl + z` | Undo the last action |\r\n| `Ctrl + Shift + z` | Repeat the canceled action |\r\n| `Ctrl + u` | Underline text |\r\n| `Ctrl + b` | Make the selected text bold |\r\n| `Ctrl + i` | Italicize text |\r\n| `Ctrl + s` | Make the selected text crossed out |\r\n| `Ctrl + o` | Create a Numbered list from the selection |\r\n| `Ctrl + m` | Create a Bulleted list from the selection |\r\n| `Ctrl + l` | Clear formatting and delete links |\r\n| `Ctrl + p` | Open the Print menu |\r\n| `Ctrl + '` | Enable / Turn off spell checking |\r\n\r\nYou can also change the color of the selected text and its background. \r\n\r\nIt will be useful for computer users to use [keyboard shortcuts](/en/notepad/shortcut)"}
