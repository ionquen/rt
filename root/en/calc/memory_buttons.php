Usually, the results of intermediate calculations are recorded in this cell, for example, if we need to find the sum of the numbers that we first need to find. If this process becomes more complicated, then we need to save intermediate values somewhere, for example, rewrite them on a piece of paper or save them in an electronic text notebook. \r\n\r\nThe presence of a memory cell simplifies the calculation process. The value stored in this cell can be changed during the calculation. \r\n\r\nTo interact with the memory cell , the following buttons were invented:\r\n\r\n| Button | Destination |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| `MR` | Reads the stored value from memory and inserts it into the input field (or replaces the entire string with the value from memory) |\r\n| `MS` | Saves the result of the calculation to memory |\r\n| `MC` | Clears the memory cell, that is, makes it empty |\r\n| `M+` | Adds the result of the current calculation to the value in the memory cell |\r\n| `M-` | Subtracts the result of the current calculation from the value in the memory cell |\r\n\r\nThe abbreviation of these buttons is very simple:\r\n\r\n| Abbreviation | Decryption |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| `MR` | Memory Read  |\r\n| `MS` | Memory Save |\r\n| `MC` | Memory Clear |\r\n\r\nIf we type `20 × 20` and press `=`, we get the result of the calculation equal to `40`. After clicking on the `MS` button, we will save this result in memory. We clear the input field (usually with the `C` button) and make new calculations, for example, `6 × 6`, press `=` and get the answer in the form of `36`. Now we can interact with both the value in memory and the current result. Pressing `M+` will add the number `36` to `40` and save it back to the cell. The `M-` button will perform similar actions. Pressing the `MS` button will save the current value to memory, that is, now there will be the number `36`. Pressing the `MC` button will clear the memory. \r\n\r\nYou may wonder why these memory cells, if there are brackets, and all calculations can be performed in one expression? The answer is simple: there are situations in which using memory cells will simplify calculations. The presence of such functionality in the calculator may come in handy from time to time. Knowing about memory cells will greatly help in such moments.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that in many calculators the `MS` button is missing. Instead , the following combination is turned: \r\n1. Initially, chilo `0` is stored in memory\r\n2. Pressing the `M+` and `M-` buttons adds and subtracts from the value in the cell, respectively. \r\n3. Pressing `MR` also reads the number from memory\r\n4. Pressing `MC` deletes the value from memory, or assigns `0` there\r\n5. We can write a new number to memory again\r\n\r\nAn improved online calculator is presented on our website. It contains several memory cells, which allows you to temporarily save several calculation results."}
